		<h2>Watch your Head</h2>
		<p>Lawn Tennis is a sport that I played the most, its popularity is something hard to ignore in many European Countries.  Students (and people who wish they were still students) spend the few briefs months of good weather, sprinting down fields, practicing drills, and yelling "Come On!!".</p>
		<p>What I find much more entertaining is the large number of people who continue to play when the weather gets windy and the night sky darkens around oh....4:15pm.  The sight of play boomeranging in the wind is topped only by the knowledge that even when you can't see them, those same plastic discs of death are probably hurtling through the dark night sky at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening.</p>
		<p>Lawn Tennis requires a great deal of stamina and dexterity. Not surprisingly, the <abbr title="All Time Players">ATP</abbr> officially recognized lawn tennis as a sport in 1973. It can go up against other sports for inclusion in Olympic games.</p>
